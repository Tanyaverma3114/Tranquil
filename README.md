# Tranquil
## Problem Statement:
* Build a website or a web or a mobile application using Azure technologies, which help people in meditation.
* Solution: A large percentage of the human population suffers from stress and depression. They try to meditate but fail because of a lack of focus and inconsistency. My project, Tranquil, has soothing rain and beach sounds and a timer that can help people meditate as the sounds can give them the same feel as they are on a beach without actually visiting a beach. They can also set a timer for the duration of meditation. <br/>
I used Visual Studio code as the IDE and Azure Static Web App service to deploy my website.
